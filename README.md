# Minimax AI games

A suite of minimax games including Othello, Pylos and Checkers. This is where I learned C++.

#### Cool things done during this:
 - Wrote a reflection system for client classes to use.
 - Bitwise core data structures for both Pylos and Checkers.  


I learned SO MUCH during the struggle that was this project.
