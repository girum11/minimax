Minimax--CPE-305-
===========================

My work from Clint Staley's CPE 305 course.  A suite of minimax games including Othello, Pylos and Checkers.  

Comes with an internal reflection system, and makes heavy use of bit-manipulation in its core data structures for both Pylos and Checkers.  I learned SO MUCH during this project.
