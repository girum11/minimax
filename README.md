# Minimax--CPE-305-

My work from Clint Staley's CPE 305 course.  A suite of minimax games including Othello, Pylos and Checkers.  

Othello was given, Pylos was interfaced but not implemented, and Checkers was 100% student work.  

#### Cool things done during this:
 - Wrote a reflection system for client classes to use.
 - Bitwise core data structures for both Pylos and Checkers.  


I learned SO MUCH during the struggle that was this project.
