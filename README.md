# Minimax AI Games

A suite of minimax games including Othello, Pylos and Checkers. This is where I learned C++.

#### Some cool things done during this:
 - Wrote bitwise core data structures for both Pylos and Checkers. E.g. Checkers board state represented by three integers.
 - Designed computer AIs using Minimax tree analysis.
  - Command design pattern used to support undo/redo queues.
 - Wrote a C++ reflection system for client classes to use. 
 - Automated tests to last a lifetime.


I learned SO MUCH during the struggle that was this project.
