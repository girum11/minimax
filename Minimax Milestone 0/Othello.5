--1.) A player with no moves must make a "Pass" move (and we permit Pass only in that case).  We end the game when both players have just made Pass moves.

-- Step to the *almost* end of the game, then GetAllMoves() to show that players can't Pass.  Slowly step to the end of the game showing Pass moves.  Show Board's value as you step to ensure that the game ends at the right moment.

--2.) What if the move that you play is outside of the board's range?
enterMove [-1,0]
enterMove [0,-1]
enterMove [-1,0]
enterMove [7,8]
enterMove [8,7]

--3.) What if you pass in bad input for the move?  Test non-numeric characteres, missing dimensions, trailing garbage, preceding garbage, and extra whitespace.
enterMove [a,0]
enterMove [0,a]
enterMove [0,]
enterMove [,0]

--9.) OthelloMove comparison tests:  I have 100% code coverage of two comparison methods with these tests.
enterMove [1,1]
-- Greater than

compareMove [0,1]
compareMove [1,0]
-- Equal to
compareMove [1,1]
-- Less than

--10.) Board valuation tests: end game showVal for black and white wins

--  "if the game is over then GetValue returns winVal if first player has won, -winVal if the second player has won, and 0 in the case of a draw."
-- Black win

--11a.) Key comparison tests -- test of identical board values, but different "mWhoseMove" values.
--11b.) Also, test to verify that compareKeys doesn't mess with the setOptions
-- "Two OthelloBoard::Keys are equal if all squares have same color of piece (or are both empty) and if the next player to move is the same."

-- 30.) I need more "GUI" input sanity checks on the strings that have been inputted.


-- Get 100% coverage on compareMove

-- Test showMoveHist

-- "SetOptions is a gold mine for bugs"

-- Verify that tabs in strings are still valid strings.


-- 31.) END GAME tests
